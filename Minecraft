Minecraft
There's no time lapse
I spent week after week now my time's elapsed
I construct the building that I'm laying in
Brick by brick is caving in
The creeper is near I could hear the explosion
Rattle the structure foundation eroding
Diamond swords just turned to rust
The mobs swarming in I got to taste the dust
Surival of the fittest
Isle of the wicked
Gotta stay proficient
I will not be ended
Ender man immenint patiently waiting for me to slip up and peace with the eyes
I am the sky I am the haze
I am the biome give life from the raze
I am the sky I am the haze
I am the biome give life from the raze
They will never faze me 
Pickaxe will send me to heaven
I'm building building never stopping til I get it
I'm in it to win it killin' em, hitting em
I don't think they know who I am
Came from the Nether
Arose from the grave 
They will know my name
They will know my pain when I end the game
Cannot be contained
I sip a splash 
I unleash the wrath
I've ascended and I'm never going back
